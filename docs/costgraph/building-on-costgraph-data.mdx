# Building on Costgraph Data

Learn how Costgraph can be used to develop tooling to provide insights for your infrastructure.

In this example, we explore the power of LLMs with a chat-based application powered by the Costgraph knowledge base.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';
// @ts-ignore
import DemoVideo from '@site/static/video/building_on_costgraph.mp4';

export const BuildingOnCostgraph = () => {
    return (
        <div className="video">
            <ReactPlayer playing controls url={DemoVideo} />
        </div>
    );
}
